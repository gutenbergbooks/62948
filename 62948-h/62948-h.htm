<h2><span class="small">Editor&rsquo;s Note</span></h2>
<p>Louisiana&rsquo;s cultural heritage dates back to approximately 10,000 B.C.
when man first entered this region. Since that time, many other Indian
groups have settled here. All of these groups, as well as the more recent
whites and blacks, have left evidence of their presence in the archaeological
record. The Anthropological Study series published by the Department of
Culture, Recreation &amp; Tourism, Office of Cultural Development provides
a readable account of various activities of these cultural groups.</p>
<p>Jon L. Gibson, a professional archaeologist with a long-standing interest
in the Poverty Point culture, is the author of &ldquo;Poverty Point: A Culture
of the Lower Mississippi Valley,&rdquo; the seventh in the series. In this volume,
Jon Gibson describes the Poverty Point culture&mdash;one of the most spectacular
episodes in Louisiana&rsquo;s past. Few people realize that the Poverty Point
site, at 1000 B.C., was the commercial and governmental center of its day.
In its time, the Poverty Point site had the largest, most elaborate earthworks
anywhere in the western hemisphere. No other Louisiana earthen
constructions approached the size of the Poverty Point site until the nineteenth
century.</p>
<p>This volume tries to reconstruct from the archaeological remains the
life of these bygone people. It discusses where these people lived, what they
ate and how they made their tools. It also attempts to reconstruct their social
organization and government.</p>
<p>We trust the reader will enjoy this introduction to the fascinating Poverty
Point people.</p>

<p>Much of what I know, think, and say about Poverty Point is due to Dr.
Clarence Webb. Our close association and collaboration on Poverty Point
matters go back to 1969 when we cooperated in a study of the large Carl
Alexander collection. The mutual respect and friendship spawned by that
association have grown over the years, even though our views on the Poverty
Point site and culture have not always coincided. We were to have
coauthored this booklet, but circumstances would not permit. I have forged
ahead, under his prodding, and hope the results will be to his liking. His
thoughtful critique of an earlier version of this report has improved the current
one immeasurably.</p>

<h2 id="c2"><span class="small">INTRODUCTION</span></h2>
<p>Until a few years ago, Poverty Point culture was a major archaeological
mystery. The mystery centered around the ruins of a large, prehistoric
Indian settlement, the Poverty Point site in northeastern Louisiana. Poised
on a bluff overlooking Mississippi River swamplands was a group of massive
earthworks. It was not the earthworks themselves that were so mysterious,
although they were unusual. Eastern North America was after all
the acknowledged home of the &ldquo;Mound Builders,&rdquo; originally believed to be
an extinct, superior race but now known to have been ancestors of various
Indian tribes. No, the mystery lay in the age and the size of the earthworks.</p>
<p>Radiocarbon dates indicated that they were built at least a thousand
years before the birth of Christ. This was a time when Phoenicians were
plying warm Mediterranean waters spreading trade goods and the Ugaritian
alphabet. This was a time when the Hittites were warlords of the Middle
East. It was before the founding of Rome; even the ascendancy of the
Etruscans was still centuries away. Rameses II sat on the throne of Egypt.
Moses had just led the Israelites out of Egyptian bondage in quest of the
Promised Land. David and Solomon were kings of Israel.</p>
<p>In America where written history is lacking, Native Americans of 2000
to 1000 B.C. were thought to have been wandering hunters and gatherers
living in small bands or at best simple tribes. Such unsophisticated groups
were not considered capable of raising earthworks like those at the Poverty
Point site. Archaeologists believed that such massive construction
projects were possible only when large numbers of people started living together
in permanent villages and when political control over villagers
reached the point where labor could be organized and directed toward
building and maintaining community projects, such as civic or religious
centers or monuments. These conditions&mdash;large, permanent villages and effective
political power&mdash;were normally found only among peoples whose
economy was based on agriculture. In America that usually meant maize
(corn).</p>
<p>Were we to believe that Poverty Point might have successfully integrated
these factors&mdash;large populations, political strength, and maize agriculture&mdash;while
everyone else in America north of Mexico was still adhering
to a much simpler existence? If so, it meant that Poverty Point was one of
<span class="pb" id="Page_2">2</span>
the first communities, if not <i>the</i> first, to rise above its contemporaries and
start the long journey to becoming a truly advanced society.</p>
<p>If Poverty Point did represent the awakening of complex society in the
United States, how and why did it develop? Was its emergence caused by
immigrants, bearing corn and a new religion, from somewhere in Mexico
(Ford 1969:181)? Did it develop locally but under Mexican stimulation (Webb
1977:60-61)? Did it come about by itself without foreign influences (Gibson
1974)?</p>
<p>These were some of the major questions that surrounded Poverty
Point. The lack of agreement on these issues created an aura of mystery
and promoted the idea that Poverty Point was an enigma, or puzzle. When
Poverty Point was not simply being ignored in discussions of Southeastern
prehistory during the 1950s-1960s, it was usually portrayed as an unusual
cultural complex that burst upon the Lower Mississippi Valley landscape,
flourished for a while, and then disappeared leaving no trace among succeeding
cultures.</p>
<p>Time has begun to change these perceptions. Poverty Point is no longer
regarded as a geographic or developmental irregularity. New research
during the last three decades has shown that the Poverty Point way of life
was not confined to the big town at the main site, but extended over a large
region and encompassed many peoples. Even with increased knowledge,
Poverty Point still remains exceptional; yet it is no longer regarded as being
out of step with Native American cultural evolution or as a historical flower
that blossomed before its time. There are still many unresolved questions
about Poverty Point culture. In the following pages, we will explore these
questions and our current state of knowledge in order to present a reasonable
picture of life in the Lower Mississippi Valley during Poverty Point
times.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_3">3</div>
<h2 id="c3"><span class="small">POVERTY POINT CULTURE: A DEFINITION</span></h2>
<p>Poverty Point culture was a widespread pattern of life followed by certain
Indian peoples in the Lower Mississippi Valley between 2000 and 700
B.C. This general lifeway stretched roughly from a northerly point near the
junction of the Mississippi and Arkansas rivers, (above the present-day
town of Greenville, Mississippi) down the Mississippi Valley to the Gulf
Coast (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). It covered parts of Louisiana, Arkansas, and Mississippi,
and its influences reached as far as Florida along the eastern coast and as
far up valley as Tennessee and Missouri.</p>
<p>One should not get the idea that Poverty Point peoples from one end
of this large region to the other were exactly alike. They did not comprise
a single body of kinfolks or a nation. They almost certainly spoke different
languages. It is likely that Poverty Point peoples were divided into a number
of socially, politically, and ethnically separate groups.</p>
<p>What these people did have in common was participation, to varying
degrees, in a far-reaching system of trade and manufacture or use of certain
artifacts. Recognition of these artifacts is how archaeologists differentiate
between Poverty Point sites and sites of different cultures. Some
of these characteristic artifacts include clay cooking balls, clay figurines,
small stone tools called microflints, plummets, and finely-crafted stone
beads and pendants (<a href="#fig2">Figure 2</a>). Several things distinguish Poverty Point
artifacts. One is the decided preference for materials imported from other
regions. The other is the emphasis on ground and polished stone artifacts,
especially ornaments and other status insignias.</p>
<p>Radiocarbon and thermoluminescence dates show that Poverty Point
culture developed over a long period of time. By 3000 B.C., many of the
typical artifacts were already in use. A few items had appeared even earlier.
During the next thousand years, new artifacts and new styles were
added, and by 2000-1800 B.C., an early stage of Poverty Point culture had
evolved in some areas. However, the period between 1500 and 700 B.C. was
the most climactic, because that was the span dominated by the giant Poverty
Point site.</p>

<h2 id="c4"><span class="small">SETTLEMENT</span></h2>
<p>A map showing the Lower Mississippi Valley in 1000 B.C., during the
zenith of Poverty Point culture, reveals some very interesting things. Population
was concentrated in certain areas and these areas were separated
from each other, sometimes by scores of miles (<a href="#fig1">Figure 1</a>). While this pattern
of geographic isolation may be due in part to river erosion and spotty
archaeological investigation, it almost surely reflects preferences for certain
kinds of land. There were at least 10 population clusters in the area.
The largest concentration was in the Yazoo Basin of western Mississippi.
Another surrounded the Poverty Point site itself in the Upper Tensas Basin-Macon
Ridge region of northeastern Louisiana.</p>
<p>Lying between these various population clusters were stretches of uninhabited
or lightly occupied land. In possibly one or two cases, intervening
areas may have supported populations almost as concentrated as Poverty
Point territories but, for various reasons, these peoples did not participate
regularly or intensively in Poverty Point culture.</p>
<p>Our map of 1000 B.C. shows another interesting feature. The scattered
Poverty Point population clusters were all linked by waterways.
Every one was tied to the Mississippi River. Even though the Mississippi
River did not run through every concentration, its major tributaries and
distributaries did. These interconnected streams must have been the highways
that carried people, trade goods, and ideas.</p>
<p>Most of the population lived in permanent villages along these streams.
There were small, medium, and large villages, ranging in size from less than
an acre to over 100 acres. The smallest settlements probably housed only
a few families, while residents at some of the larger ones must have numbered
in the hundreds, possibly even more. One site among them was a
veritable metropolis for the day; the population at the Poverty Point site
itself has been estimated to number several thousands (Ford and Webb
1956; Gibson 1973). In addition to these stable villages, there were temporary
campsites, where villagers evidently took advantage of seasonally
available foods and other resources.</p>
<p>Larger villages were often distinguished from smaller ones by more
than population numbers. One or more villages in nearly every Poverty
Point territory were set apart by public construction works, usually mounds
and sometimes embankments. Mounds were made of dirt and were usually
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
dome-shaped affairs constructed in several stages. Two unique mounds at
the Poverty Point site have been identified as bird effigies (Ford 1955).
Typically one mound stood at these villages, but two to eight mounds were
present in some instances (Webb 1977:11-13).</p>
<p>As a general rule, the number and size of these works varied directly
with village size and population. Even though several of these mounds have
been excavated, their purpose is still unclear. They superficially resemble
mounds used as tombs by later cultures, but no burials have turned up in
the Poverty Point structures. Beneath a mound of this type at the Poverty
Point site was a bed of ashes and a burned human bone, suggesting that,
at least in this example, it covered a cremation (Ford and Webb 1956:38).
Embankments, or artificial ridges, were occasionally built at these bigger
villages. In many cases, embankments seem to have been raised by a combination
of construction and incidental accumulation of living refuse. Most
of the giant ridges at Poverty Point seem to have grown this way (Ford and
Webb 1956; Kuttruff 1975). However, not all of these ridges positively
served as foundations for houses. Some served to connect mounds, others
perhaps to mark alignments of some kind.</p>
<p>There was evidently no standard architectural arrangement involving
mounds and ridges, but semicircular patterns occurred most often. The
largest example is at the giant Poverty Point town (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>). Linear plans
were also used, and some sites show no recognizable designs. These various
arrangements have been said to reflect everything from astronomical
observatories to possible &ldquo;fortresses.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Of all the similarities and differences among territorial settlement patterns,
several things stand out. Villages in each province ranged from small
to large and from simple to complex, and every province had one village
that stood apart from all the rest. This main village was probably the regional
&ldquo;capital.&rdquo; Such an arrangement also seems applicable to the provinces
themselves. They, like the villages within their bounds, can be ranked
in importance according to the intensity of interaction with the major province.
Lest there be any doubt, that supreme province lay along the Macon
Ridge-Upper Tensas lowlands in extreme northeastern Louisiana. Its
&ldquo;capital&rdquo; was the great town of Poverty Point. Because of its dominating
influence, this magnificent town will be described in detail.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_9">9</div>
<p>It was first reported by Samuel Lockett in 1873 and was visited many
times afterwards. However, it was during excavations, sponsored by the
American Museum of Natural History in the early 1950s, that its true
nature came to be realized (Ford and Webb 1956). From aerial photographs
came the startling realization&mdash;Poverty Point was a giant earthwork. It
was so large that the bumps and ridges, apparent from a ground-level view,
were once thought to be natural. The symmetrical geometry revealed on
the photographs, however, led everyone to believe that it had been built
from a &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; in a single, all-out construction effort. Its great size,
coupled with the millions of artifacts scattered over and in the artificial
constructions, gave the impression that it was home for literally thousands
and a magnet for multitudes of visitors. Even though new information has
begun to change some of these ideas, it has not diminished the massiveness
of the engineering feat or appreciation for the collective spirit of those
long-ago builders whose vision and toil is represented there.</p>
<p>As one can see from the &ldquo;city map&rdquo; (<a href="#fig3">Figure 3</a>), the town was divided
into several areas. The main area in the middle of town was dominated by a
semicircular or partially octagonal enclosure. The enclosure was produced
by six artificial, earthen embankments which formed concentric arcs. Extra
ridges were outlined in the western sector, and the outer ridge terminated
before reaching the south sector. The ridges were between 50 and 150 feet
apart and about the same in width. They were 4 to 6 feet tall. Between them
were low areas, or swales, apparently where much of the construction dirt
had been removed. From one end of the outer arc to the other was 3950 feet,
or nearly three-quarters of a mile. Opposite ends of the interior or smallest
embankment were 1950 feet apart. All of the ridges terminated at the edge
of a bluff, which dropped steeply some 20 feet below to a stream which
paralleled the entire eastern side of the earthwork.</p>
<p>Formerly, archaeologists suspected that the ridges formed a complete
circle or octagon and that the Arkansas River, which once flowed by the
site, had eaten away the eastern side. Recent geological information and
studies of activity patterns on the site, patterns that include both
occupational and architectural tasks, now show that the enclosure was
always semicircular. The bluff that marks the eastern edge of the site
today and which seems to have cut into the earthwork was formed
thousands of years before building ever started. In fact, the bluff edge has
probably retreated very little since the time of earthwork construction.</p>
<p>The ridges were divided into five sectors by four aisles, or corridors.
These openings range from 35 to 160 feet in width. They did not converge
<span class="pb" id="Page_10">10</span>
at a single point in the middle of the enclosure; neither did they divide the
encircling embankments into equal-size areas.</p>
<p>The middle of the enclosure, or plaza, was relatively flat and covered
an area of about 37 acres. At the eastern edge lay an oval mound (Bluff
Mound). Whether it was built during Poverty Point times or during the Civil
War, as claimed by some, is not certain.</p>
<p>Outside the central area were other earthworks (<a href="#fig4">Figure 4</a>). These included
mounds and other embankments, as well as depressions. Physically
connected to the outermost arc in the western sector was a huge mound
(Mound A). The mound had an unusual shape which reminded some experts
of a bird. It stood over 70 feet high and measured 640 feet along the
&ldquo;wing&rdquo; and 710 feet from &ldquo;head to tail.&rdquo; The flattened, or so-called &ldquo;tail,&rdquo;
section of the monster structure was actually built in a pit some 12 or more
feet deep. Another similar but slightly smaller mound (Motley Mound) was
built 1.5 miles north of the central embankments. Because it had only a lobe
where the &ldquo;bird&rsquo;s tail&rdquo; should have been, it was believed to be unfinished
(Ford and Webb 1956:18).</p>
<p>Three more structures were positioned along a north-south line that
passed through the central &ldquo;bird&rdquo; mound. About 0.4 mile north of the big
mound was a conical construction (Mound B) covering a possible cremation.
Some 600 feet south lay a square, earthen structure with a depression in
the center. The function of this mound, like all the others, remains uncertain.
There are even doubts about its man-made nature. A curving ridge
connected this mound with the aisle separating the western and southwestern
sectors. About 1.6 miles further south along the same axis was a
second dome, the Lower Jackson Mound, the southernmost structure of the
Poverty Point complex.</p>
<p>Some other earthworks&mdash;a comma-shaped ridge and at least one mound
on the Jackson Place immediately south of the central enclosure&mdash;were
probably once part of the overall complex. Unfortunately they have been
destroyed.</p>
<p>Some of the dirt for the earthworks had been dug from borrow pits that
lay outside the embankments. One large one stretched along the entire periphery
of the southwestern sector (Figures <a href="#fig3">3</a> &amp; <a href="#fig4">4</a>). A balk, or &ldquo;bridge,&rdquo;
crossed the center of this depression. An even larger pit ran north from the
bird mound to Mound B. Smaller ones dotted the area around the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of
the bird mound and north of Mound B. These would have formed large
ponds, and one cannot help but wonder if we might not be looking at an ancient,
municipal water system or perhaps fish ponds, where catfish and other
species might have been &ldquo;farmed&rdquo; or kept until needed.</p>

<p>The majority of the population apparently lived on the embankments
in the central area, but appreciable numbers of people lived outside. Important
&ldquo;suburbs&rdquo; were scattered along the bluff between the central district
and Motley Mound, to the west of Motley Mound, to the west and south
of the bird mound, on the Jackson Place, and south to Lower Jackson. Other
peripheral neighborhoods will no doubt eventually be discovered.</p>
<p>Nothing much is known about Poverty Point houses and furnishings.
Probable house outlines were reported from Jaketown (Ford, Phillips, and
Haag 1955: Figure 10) and Poverty Point (Webb 1977:13). Stains in the soil,
called postmolds, showed these structures to have been circular and small,
around 13 to 15 feet in diameter. One possible burned house at Poverty Point
appears to have been a semi-subterranean structure, framed with bent poles
and covered with cane thatch and daub (dried mud). Interior furnishings
were not recognized.</p>
<p>Numerous postmolds have been found at many Poverty Point sites, but
so far no other complete patterns have been identified. On the western side
of the plaza at the Poverty Point site, an archaeologist excavated some unusually
large pits. If these were postmolds, they held posts the size of grown
trees! Too big for ordinary or even superordinary residences, these huge
posts are said by some to have been markers for important days like equinoxes
and solstices, an American Stonehenge.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_13">13</div>
<h2 id="c5"><span class="small">FOODS</span></h2>
<p>When the real size and magnificence of Poverty Point came to be realized
in the 1950s, it was believed that such developments were possible
only when agriculture or a similarly efficient means of food production were
known. In North America this agriculture was assumed to be based on corn,
beans and squash because when Europeans arrived in the New World, these
were the staple crops. But evidence for agriculture involving these foods
has so far not been found in indisputable Poverty Point contexts. This lack
was not altogether due to recovery or identification problems because plant
remains have turned up at several sites, including Poverty Point itself.</p>
<p>Poverty Point culture might have developed without agriculture. One
idea was that ordinary hunting, fishing, and collecting in special localities
could have been the basis of Poverty Point livelihoods (Gibson 1973). In
areas with generous expanses of elevated lands and swampy river bottoms,
wild plant and animal foods were not only bountiful, they were present
year-round. By precise timing of food-getting efforts with nature&rsquo;s
seasonal rhythms, Poverty Point peoples could have gotten all the food they
needed and probably as much extra as they desired.</p>
<p>Another suggestion was that Poverty Point life might have involved
farming all right, but of a different kind. Mounting evidence showed that a
unique brand of horticulture had developed in eastern North America before
Poverty Point culture ever began. The plants that were grown included
sunflower, sumpweed, probably goosefoot, and possibly others.
Other than sunflower, you would be right in thinking these are not widely
cultivated species today, although they are common garden plants. They
are notorious weeds and modern science has produced a variety of herbicides
to get rid of them. However, they are easy to propagate. Native cultivation
need not have involved anything more than scattering seeds over
open ground. These plants produced enormous quantities of nutritional
seeds. Thus, from the point of view of return for amount of work invested,
this kind of gardening would have been economically efficient. Unlike other
agriculture, this kind of farming&mdash;if it really can be called that&mdash;would have
fit in quite well with hunting, fishing and plant collecting.</p>
<p>We are only starting to find out what kinds of wild foods were eaten,
and of these, animals are better known than plants because their bones are
more resistant to decay and are easier to find. From the Gulf to the northernmost
<span class="pb" id="Page_14">14</span>
inland territories, meat sources included fish, reptiles, small and
large mammals, and birds (Smith 1974; Gagliano and Webb 1970; Byrd 1978;
Jackson 1981). Shellfish were collected at coastal sites, where brackish-water
clams were abundant. Oysters were not commonly eaten. Inland villagers
do not seem to have eaten freshwater mussels at all. Freshwater fish
seem to have been the most consistent animal food, occurring at practically
every well-preserved site throughout the Lower Mississippi Valley. Gar,
catfish, buffalo fish, sunfish, and other species were caught. Various kinds
of turtles were also commonly taken. Alligators and even snakes were
sometimes eaten. Deer were important sources of meat everywhere, probably
ranking close to fish in terms of overall contribution to local diets. Cottontail
and swamp rabbits, opossums, raccoons, squirrels, and other small
mammals were hunted, as were turkeys, sandhill cranes, and other kinds
of birds. There seems to have been considerable region-to-region and perhaps
site-to-site differences in the importance of small mammals and birds.</p>
<p>Plant foods identified from Poverty Point refuse and cooking pits include
hickory nuts, pecans, acorns, walnuts, persimmons, wild grapes, wild
beans, hackberries, and seeds from honey locust, goosefoot, knotweed, and
doveweed (?) (Shea 1978; Woodiel 1981; Jackson 1981; Byrd and Neuman
1978).</p>
<p>These remains are far from a complete list of Poverty Point table fare.
Food residues have only been recovered at a handful of sites, far too few to
make sweeping generalizations about Poverty Point subsistence. Differences
in archaeological collecting methods and in preservation conditions
from site to site inhibit detailed comparison. Present information will not
allow us to say what foods were preferred or to work out their relative contributions
to villagers&rsquo; diets.</p>
<p>Due to these problems, only general conclusions can be drawn. Even
though the quest for food remains has only just begun in earnest, the failure
of corn, beans and squash to turn up anywhere casts considerable doubt
about the traditional view of Poverty Point peoples as farmers. As a matter
of fact, of these three crops important in Southeastern Indian diets at A. D.
1600, only squash has been found anywhere in the eastern United States
as early as Poverty Point times (Byrd and Neuman 1978). Since we do not
know if the goosefoot and knotweed seeds found at Poverty Point sites were
domesticated or wild varieties, we cannot be certain whether or not Poverty
Point peoples had gardens of these native plants. All we really know,
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
at present, is that Poverty Point communities throughout the Lower Mississippi
Valley ate wild plants and animals. In the final analysis, we may
anticipate that there was no single, uniform pattern of obtaining food in the
Lower Mississippi Valley. Geographic and cultural differences were just too
great.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_16">16</div>
<h2 id="c6"><span class="small">EVERYDAY TOOLS</span></h2>
<p>Hunting and collecting were basic to Poverty Point economy everywhere,
and rather specialized equipment was designed to aid in these food
quests. The bow and arrow was unknown. The javelin was the main hunting
device. These throwing spears were tipped with a variety of stone
points. Some points, like the ones illustrated in <a href="#fig5">Figure 5</a>, were exclusive
Poverty Point styles, but many were forms which had been made for
hundreds, even thousands, of years before.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig5">

<p class="pcap">Figure 5. Javelin Points. a-b, Motley; c-d, f, Epps; e, Pontchartrain. Photographs courtesy

</div>
<p>Casting distance and power were increased by the use of atlatls, or
spear-throwers. Shaped like oversized crochet needles, atlatls were held in
the throwing hand with the hooked end inserted into a shallow socket in the
butt of the spear (<a href="#fig6">Figure 6</a>). Hurled with a smooth, gliding motion, the javelin
was released toward the target while the atlatl remained in the hand.</p>
<p>Atlatl hooks were sometimes made of carved antler (Webb 1977, Figure
26), and polished stone weights supposedly were attached to the wooden
handles. These atlatl weights came in a variety of sizes and shapes, including
rectangular, diamond, oval, and boat-shaped bars and a host of unusual
forms (<a href="#fig7">Figure 7</a>). Some were quite elaborate with lustrous finishes and engraved
decorations. Repair holes reveal their value to owners.</p>

<p>The hunter also used plummets (<a href="#fig8">Figure 8</a>). These objects were ground
from heavy lumps of magnetite, hematite, limonite, and occasionally other
stones. Shaped like plumb bobs or big teardrops, they often had encircling
grooves or drilled holes in the small end. Several explanations of their function
have been suggested, but the idea that they were bola weights seems
most likely.</p>

<p>Other kinds of hunting equipment, such as nets, snares, traps, etc.,
were probably used by Poverty Point hunters, but because they were made
of materials that decay easily, their use can only be determined because the
bones of nocturnal animals occur among food remains. The presence of fishbones,
ranging from tiny minnows to giant gar, implies that fishermen used
some sort of device or technique for mass catches. None of the fishing
equipment, known from contemporary villages like Bayou Jasmine near
Lake Pontchartrain (Duhe 1976), has been recognized at Poverty Point villages.</p>
<p>We know that men and women must have used other tools to obtain
food, but we are unable to say which of the many other chipped and ground
items were used in this way. Gathering plant foods such as nuts, acorns,
seeds, fruits, berries, greens, and &ldquo;vegetables&rdquo; probably did not require
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
implements, other than what may have been handy. Digging tubers would
have required some sort of device, but it need not have been anything other
than a convenient pointed stick. However, hoe-like tools have been found
at several Poverty Point villages and in abundance at Terral Lewis, a small
hamlet about 10 miles southeast of Poverty Point. Some of these objects
have coatings which look like melted glass. The coatings are fused opal,
produced when the &ldquo;hoes&rdquo; cut through sod. These artifacts might have been
real hoes used to till gardens, but in view of the total absence of domesticated
plant remains from Poverty Point sites, this function remains unconfirmed.</p>
<p>Foods were prepared with a variety of implements. Meat could have
been cut up with the aid of heavy chipped bifaces (&ldquo;cleavers&rdquo;) and sharp
flakes or blades (&ldquo;knives&rdquo;). Battered rocks, pitted stones, and mortars might
have served to pound nuts, acorns, and seeds into flour and oil (<a href="#fig9">Figure 9</a>).</p>

<p>Cooking was done over hearths and in earth ovens. The earth oven was
an ingenious Poverty Point invention. Nothing more than a hole in the
ground to which hot baked clay objects were added, the earth oven was an
efficient heat-regulating and energy-conserving facility. Small objects of
baked clay were used to heat these baking pits (<a href="#fig10">Figure 10</a>). These little objects
were hand molded. Fingers, palms, and sometimes tools were used to
fashion dozens of different styles. These objects are a distinguishing hallmark
of Poverty Point culture. So common are they that archaeologists refer
to them as Poverty Point objects.</p>

</div>
<p>Modern experiments in earth oven cooking have been conducted
(Hunter 1975; Gibson 1975). It was discovered through these experiments
that the shapes of clay objects used determined the intensity and duration
of temperatures inside the pits. This might have been a way of regulating
cooking conditions, just like setting the time and power level in modern microwave
ovens. Another important aspect of earth oven cooking is that it
would have conserved firewood, which must have been a precious commodity
around long-occupied villages.</p>
<p>Like modern Americans, Poverty Point peoples had a variety of vessels
<span class="pb" id="Page_22">22</span>
and contraptions for cooking, storage, and simple containment. They
used vessels&mdash;pots and bowls&mdash;made of stone and baked clay. Stone vessels
were chiseled out of soft sandstone and steatite (a dense, soft rock). Most
stone vessels were plain but a few had decorations. Holes drilled near cracks
show that these vessels were often repaired. Steatite was imported by the
tons to the Poverty Point site from quarries in northern Georgia and Alabama
(Webb 1944, 1977).</p>
<p>The Poverty Point pottery vessels mark the initial appearance of this
kind of container in the Lower Mississippi Valley. Although not abundant,
their presence has been accorded great historical significance by archaeologists.
One archaeologist even argued that the art of making pottery was
learned from Indians in South or Central America or through intermediaries
along the Atlantic and eastern Gulf coasts. This view is very controversial.
Other archaeologists prefer to think that ceramics, whatever their
origin, were made by later people and that their appearance in Poverty
Point garbage deposits was due to subsequent disturbances which churned
and mixed earlier and later remains. And then there are other archaeologists
who contend that Poverty Point people developed and made pottery
largely on their own.</p>
<p>The extreme differences in pottery throughout the various Poverty
Point territories support the latter view. In order to prevent cracking, some
Poverty Point potters added vegetable fibers to the clay; others put sand
and grit, bone particles, and hard lumps of clay; others added nothing. Decorations
do seem to have followed rather universal styles, but each group
of potters seems to have modified them to suit local tastes and to have added
new features of their own.</p>
<p>Many other tools were used in everyday tasks of building houses,
butchering animals and making other tools. We know Poverty Point peoples
used stone tools for these jobs and probably also used wood, bone and
antler ones, as well. Most of these were very similar to those used by earlier
people.</p>
<p>Items such as hammerstones, whetstones, polishers, and others, were
used mainly in a natural condition and required little or no preparation
themselves. The characteristic shapes and signs of alteration that permit
them to be recognized today got there through use and not intentional design.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_23">23</div>
<p>Other tools were carefully shaped. Gouges, adzes, axes, and drills fall
into this category. The objects were chipped from large pieces of gravel or
big flakes into desired shapes. Often polish or tiny grooves appear on the
working edges of these tools, which leads us to suspect that they were used
to chop and carve wood, dig holes, and drill substances.</p>
<p>Some of these items, especially celts and adzes (cutting tools with the
blades set at right angles to the handles), have counterparts of ground and
polished stone. These smoothed objects were made by chipping, battering,
grinding, and polishing in combination or singly. Whether these more elaborate
forms were used like their chipped varieties is difficult to say, but they
probably were.</p>
<p>There is another group of chipped stone artifacts which is one of the
most abundant tool classes at the Poverty Point and Jaketown sites and
which occurs in respectable numbers at many Poverty Point villages (Webb
1977:42). These mysterious objects are called microliths. The most common
form has been dubbed a Jaketown perforator (Haag and Webb 1953: Ford
and Webb 1956). Typically, perforators are tiny artifacts, made from blades
and flakes; they have one bulbous end and a narrow point. They were originally
presumed to be drills or punches, but experiments showed that they
could have been worn-out scrapers, resulting from whittling antler, bone,
and perhaps wood (Ford and Webb 1956:77). Their abundance at Poverty
Point and Jaketown suggests a rather commonplace function, and perhaps
the experimental results have been rightly interpreted. Recently, however,
an archaeologist made a revealing discovery. He noticed an obstruction
in the bottom of an unfinished hole that was drilled in the center of a
narrow-ended, rectangular stone tablet. Using a straight pin, he dislodged
a small flint object. It was the broken end of a Jaketown perforator; so perhaps,
they were used as drills after all!</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_24">24</div>
<h2 id="c7"><span class="small">SYMBOLIC OBJECTS AND CEREMONIES</span></h2>
<p>Poverty Point culture had many unique objects, but perhaps most important
were its artifacts of personal adornment and symbolic meaning. In
no other preceding or contemporary culture were so many ornaments and
status symbols produced. Stone beads, made mostly of red jasper, predominated,
but many other unusual objects were manufactured. Pendants were
made in a multitude of geometric and zoomorphic shapes. Dominant were
birds, bird heads, animal claws, foot effigies, turtles, and open clam shell
replicas (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>). Small, in-the-round carvings of &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; and fat-bellied
owls were made and were evidently widely circulated, even among non-Poverty
Point peoples (Webb 1971). One pendant from Jaketown (Webb
1977:Figure 25) was a polished tablet with a carved human face. Copper and
galena beads and bangles were worn at the Poverty Point and Claiborne
sites. Perforated human and animal teeth, cut out sections of human jaws,
bone tubes, and bird bills (Webb 1977:52-53), dredged from the bottom
mucks of the bayou below the Poverty Point site, reveal that much more
ornamentation of perishable materials has disappeared.</p>

<div class="pb" id="Page_25">25</div>
<p>It would hardly be apt to describe the folks at Poverty Point as gaudily
dressed, but by comparison with their country neighbors living in little villages
and with their trade partners in Arkansas, Mississippi, and other sections
of Louisiana, they must have been quite &ldquo;fancy&rdquo; and impressively
clothed. Because so much personal ornamentation occurs at Poverty Point
itself, it is conceivable that social distinctions there were more numerous
and more rigid than anywhere else at the time. There was only one Poverty
Point. It must have seemed like New Orleans on Mardi Gras, Mecca during
the pilgrimage, and Mexico City on market day&mdash;all rolled into one.</p>
<p>Hundreds of solid stone objects, such as cones, cylinders, spheres,
cubes, trapezoids, buttons (<a href="#fig11">Figure 11</a>), and others, were also made by skilled
craftsmen, mainly at the giant Poverty Point site (Webb 1977:48). Since
utilitarian functions for these small objects are difficult to imagine, they too
must have had ornamental, symbolic, or, perhaps, even religious meanings.</p>
<p>Religious and other symbolic purposes might have been served by stone
pipes. Most were shaped like ice-cream cones or fat cigars. Other smoking
tubes, made of baked clay, may have been the &ldquo;poor man&rsquo;s&rdquo; versions of sacred
pipes in regional communities outside the sphere of direct Poverty
Point control. At the Poverty Point site, tubular clay pipes may have served
more ordinary, nonreligious purposes. The presence of pipes, however,
suggests that they might have been the first calumets used by Southeastern
Indians; calumets being the most sacred symbols of intertribal relations,
used to proclaim war and peace and to honor and salute important
ceremonies and visiting dignitaries.</p>
<p>Other sacred objects may have included the small, crudely molded, clay
figurines depicting seated women, many of whom appear to be pregnant
(<a href="#fig12">Figure 12</a>). Heads were nearly always missing, although whether or not
they were snapped off deliberately during ceremonies is purely conjectural.
Perhaps, smaller, decorated versions of clay cooking objects may have
had religious or social symbolic value as well.</p>
<p>It is also suspected that regular everyday artifacts could be turned into
sacred ones under certain circumstances. This probably explains the 200 to
300 steatite vessels that were broken and buried in an oval pit a little southwest
of the biggest mound at the Poverty Point site (Webb 1944). They must
have been an offering of some kind. Other deposits of steatite vessels, both
whole and broken, were found at the Claiborne site on the Gulf Coast (Gagliano
<span class="pb" id="Page_26">26</span>
and Webb 1970; Bruseth 1980). Religious and social meaning can be
ascribed to virtually anything, and there need not be any recognizable intrinsic
value or unusualness. No doubt thousands of other artifacts functioned
in this nondomestic realm of behavior, and we just do not know what
they are.</p>

<p>Religion is one of the most powerful motive forces in culture. So it was
in Poverty Point culture. It provided sanctions, direction, meaning, and
explanation of great mysteries. It was central to group organization and
leadership. It was the single most important source of power and was probably
the underlying motivation for communal building projects and other
group activities.</p>
<p>But unlike the other early great religions of the New World&mdash;Chavin in
South America and Olmec in Lowland Mexico&mdash;Poverty Point religion seems
to have lacked a special religious artwork. There are a few symbolic artifacts,
such as fat-bellied owl pendants and locust effigies that have a widespread
distribution (Webb 1971), but these objects often occur in earlier
contexts and in contemporary, non-Poverty Point cultural situations. The
lack of a widespread religious art style argues against the possibility of a
universal state religion and implies that local populations had independent
systems of worship.</p>
<p>The mounds and the specialized objects that functioned in ceremonial
realms were probably all involved in some way with religion and ritual. Yet
the nature of Poverty Point religion and worship remains unknown. Ancestor
worship has been mentioned as one possibility. Amulets and charms, if
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
correctly identified, imply beliefs in spirit forces or perhaps nature spirits.
Bird representations in stone and earth suggest that birds may have been
deified. Bird symbolism was an integral part of Southeastern religions during
the Christian Era, and possibly its beginnings were in Poverty Point
beliefs.</p>
<p>There is little information on Poverty Point burial practices. This is
primarily due to the fact that there have been so few excavations, and those
have been largely confined to residential areas in villages.</p>
<p>Mound B at Poverty Point covered an ash bed which contained fragments
of burned bone (Ford and Webb 1956:35). Most were tiny and unidentifiable,
but one was the upper end of a burned human femur, proving
that at least one person had been cremated and covered by the earthen
tomb.</p>
<p>Further evidence of cremation, as well as in-flesh burial, derives from
the Cowpen Slough site near Larto Lake in central Louisiana. Although
conceivably later, the burials were completely enveloped by Poverty Point
occupational deposits which seemed to be undisturbed. Since the burial area
was not completely excavated, many question marks still remain. However,
we know that adults and at least one juvenile were buried. Some were
in tightly bent positions, but the positions of others were not determined
(Baker and Webb 1978; Giardino 1981). One small pit in the burial area contained
fragments of an unburned adult in the bottom and an undisturbed
cremation of a juvenile near the top (Giardino 1981). All of the excavated
interments were close together, and the presence of surrounding postmolds
(Baker and Webb 1978) may indicate burial beneath a house floor or
some other structure. Except for a set of deer antlers, placed at the pelvis
of one of the individuals, there were no apparent burial offerings; nearby
artifacts seemed to be just household trash.</p>
<p>The only other known human remains that apparently date to the Poverty
Point period were some teeth and a lower jaw dredged from the bottom
mucks of Bayou Macon, the small stream that lies at the foot of the bluff
beneath the Poverty Point site. These were not burials, however, but ornaments!
The molars were perforated at crown bases, and the jaw section
may have been cut into shape. These objects were probably more than just
decorations; they may have served as amulets, magical charms, battle trophies,
or religious objects symbolizing revered ancestors.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<h2 id="c8"><span class="small">SOCIETY AND GOVERNMENT</span></h2>
<p>Society and government are the most difficult dimensions of prehistoric
cultures for archaeologists to reconstruct. This is because they do not
leave material remains and must be inferred indirectly. Yet social and political
institutions are basic to every culture. They are primary factors that
distinguish one group of people from another.</p>
<p>Attempts to determine social and political organization have been
mainly limited to the Poverty Point site. It is hard, especially in light of accomplishments
at the magnificent town of Poverty Point, to think of Poverty
Point society as anything other than an advanced culture, perhaps
attaining, if only momentarily, the threshold of civilization itself.</p>
<p>Political organization seems to have been as sophisticated. Just to run
a town the size of Poverty Point&mdash;the largest in the country in 1000 B.C.&mdash;must
have required administration far more complicated than that normally
found in primitive bands or simple tribes. In addition to its giant size,
there was an ambitious civic building program that required administering,
as well as commercial trade enterprises that had to be overseen. All
this pointed to strong, centralized authority and strict regulation.</p>
<p>Chiefdoms had these capabilities, and if the Poverty Point community
comprised a chiefdom, it would be the first appearance of this elaborate socio-political
institution in the prehistoric United States (Gibson 1974). The
political arm of Poverty Point seems to have reached beyond the major municipal
district. It no doubt embraced those nearby neighborhoods which
stretched for more than three miles above and below the central enclosure.
It probably extended farther to those bluff edge and lowland Villages within
a 20 to 30 mile radius of the &ldquo;capital.&rdquo; If this 400-square-mile territory does
represent the sphere of Poverty Point jurisdiction, it is likely that influence
on the outer limits was restricted to special situations. Everyday life in these
outlying villages must have normally transpired without influence or interference
from the chiefdom center. There may have been yet another jurisdictional
realm. Long-distance management, if not some degree of
control, seems evident in foreign trade relations.</p>
<p>If indeed Poverty Point did exercise three levels of administration, over
municipality, district, and commercial trade, it would have been one of the
most complex developments in prehistoric America north of Mexico. This
country would not see its like again until after A.D. 1000 and, even then,
<span class="pb" id="Page_29">29</span>
only in a few places in the East. There are dissenting views on the chiefdom
hypothesis, and it will not be surprising if future studies find that different
kinds of societies and distinctive structures, existed throughout the Lower
Mississippi culture area.</p>
<p>Regardless of whether Poverty Point communities were chiefdoms or
tribes or whether organization was complex or simple, there is no doubt that
kinship played a dominant role in holding people together. Communities
were most basically groups of kinfolks, joined by blood and marriage ties.
Social relationships were based on familiarity. Social statuses were established
by personal abilities and by birthright. The simpler the organization,
the more important was personal ability and achievement; the more complex
the society, the more important became birthright&mdash;family standing and
inheritance.</p>
<p>Various studies have revealed that the Poverty Point community was
well-ordered and highly structured. Part of that order and structure was
due to social and political factors which permeated the basic fabric of Poverty
Point society. Perhaps the best example of Poverty Point political organization
is its well-run trading system.</p>
<p>Long-distance trade was a hallmark of Poverty Point culture. Like most
other aspects of the culture, there is no consensus about the nature of the
trade. Archaeologists argue about identifications and sources of trade materials,
especially various flints, but no one questions that many materials
were moved over long distances. Some materials originated more than 700
miles from the Poverty Point site, and extreme distances of more than 1000
miles sometimes separate sources from final destinations. Trade materials
were quite varied and derived from many areas of the eastern United
States, including the Ouachita, Ozark, and Appalachian mountains and the
Upper Mississippi Valley and Great Lakes (<a href="#fig13">Figure 13</a>).</p>
<p>Poverty Point trade dealt primarily in rocks and minerals. At least so
it seems. If other things were also circulated, they left no remains. Rocks
do make good sense, however. Indians of the day made most of their tools
out of rocks; they had no metal-working technology. Rocks do occur in the
heartland of Poverty Point culture but mainly as gravels or as outcrops of
crumbly sandstones, ironstones, and other soft materials, ill-suited for
chipping. While local resources could have furnished (and did furnish for
many Lower Mississippi cultures and many periods) all the essential materials
for craft and tool &ldquo;industries,&rdquo; most of the materials imported by
Poverty Point groups were better and prettier. They were obviously highly
desired, and the quantities in which they were circulated shows that consumer
demand was high and supply systems efficient.</p>

<p>The main question about Poverty Point trade concerns how materials
were moved from one place to another. When this question first arose, one
suggestion was that gathering expeditions were sent out from the big Poverty
Point site itself (Ford and Webb 1956:125-126). Later, other means
were proposed, means ranging from the activities of wandering merchants
to ceremonial exchange systems connected with widespread festivals or religious
proselytizing.</p>
<p>It seems that several Poverty Point villages, located north of the Poverty
Point site, produced evidence that they were more directly involved
with importation and exportation of certain rocks than was Poverty Point
(Brasher 1973). In other words, these villages&mdash;Jaketown in Mississippi,
Deep Bayou in southeastern Arkansas, and others&mdash;seemed to have been
important trade outposts, where exotic materials, moving southward from
northern source areas, were amassed and then locally distributed. The remainder,
perhaps the surplus or a quota, was then sent on to the primary
trade &ldquo;market,&rdquo; the huge town at Poverty Point. There, a major share of
imported materials was consumed by folks living in the &ldquo;city limits&rdquo; and by
their neighbors in little surrounding hamlets.</p>
<p>From Poverty Point, significant quantities of exotic raw materials were
shipped further southward all the way to the Gulf of Mexico. At least some
southbound exports were prefabricated before shipment. South Louisiana
&ldquo;markets&rdquo; received a variety of raw materials but not a full array.</p>
<p>Several considerations are crucial to understanding Poverty Point
trade. First, materials from outside the region, as well as local materials,
were traded. Second, Poverty Point territories, though scattered and
widely separated, lay on or near an interconnected system of waterways
ultimately tied to the Mississippi River. This certainly supports the belief
of the importance of waterborne transport, especially in view of the bulk of
some imported materials. Third, geographic location looms as a major factor
in import-export operations. There can be no question of the importance
of the principal town of Poverty Point in the entire trade network.
This major settlement did not fall at the geographic center of the exchange
area but near the common junction of the major rivers that served as trade
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
routes. Along these rivers between Poverty Point and sources of exotic
materials were the trade outposts.</p>
<p>There are several equally plausible ways of looking at Poverty Point
trade based on our presently limited knowledge. There are additionally
many things we will probably never be able to find out, such as the motivation
for trade and the circumstances under which it transpired among
participating communities. For example, were trade relationships based on
common political alliances or allegiances? Were religious ties paramount?
Were purely capitalistic motives involved? Although we do not understand
why it occurred, we are beginning to understand its mechanics a little better.
The following is offered as one plausible reconstruction of <i>how</i> Poverty
Point trade might have operated.</p>
<p>The capital of Poverty Point trade was the giant town of Poverty Point.
It was the hub&mdash;the one place where all trade lines converged. It was the
place where raw material and commodity shipments were destined. Other
villages, located on rivers which joined Poverty Point with source areas of
exotic materials, became important as trade outposts&mdash;gateway communities
more directly involved with primary acquisition and initial relay of materials.
It is probable that these outposts, like Jaketown and Deep Bayou,
maintained rather exclusive connections with the peoples who were directly
responsible for quarrying or collecting trade materials or through
whom such materials had to first circulate. After amassing stocks of raw
materials and extracting that portion essential for local use, these trade
outposts then shipped the bulk of the commodities on to Poverty Point.</p>
<p>Some materials acquired by these gateway outposts never seem to have
been passed on to the ultimate marketplace and others were sent on in small
quantities compared with amounts actually obtained. It seems that each
outpost had its own preferences for materials and that those supplies were
used first to satisfy local needs before being exported. Yet some raw materials
appear to have passed through these outposts without major local
withdrawals. Perhaps Poverty Point was able to exercise monopolies on
certain materials, though the ultimate source of power or persuasion used
to insure them is unknown.</p>
<p>Once materials arrived at Poverty Point, several things seem to have
happened. The lion&rsquo;s share appears to have been consumed locally, mainly
at the Poverty Point site itself but also within its immediately surrounding
communities. The remaining portion seems to have been earmarked for
<span class="pb" id="Page_33">33</span>
movement on down river. Some southbound materials were passed on in
rough, or unmodified condition, but some were trimmed and partially
shaped. Some finished goods or artifacts also were distributed to southern
consumers. What might have been given in exchange by these folks who
lived in &ldquo;rockless&rdquo; areas of south Louisiana and south Mississippi is unknown
but perishable goods are often mentioned in this connection. Limited
trade in finished goods westward across southern Arkansas and
northern Louisiana has also been documented.</p>
<p>It should be reemphasized that this reconstruction of Poverty Point
trade is speculative. It is based on current data and current appreciation of
prehistoric trade relationships. Yet there are many things we do not understand
about Poverty Point trade, and the final word on this subject has
not yet been spoken.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_34">34</div>
<h2 id="c9"><span class="small">A FINAL APPRAISAL</span></h2>
<p>The preceding view of Poverty Point culture has been written much
like an ethnographer might have described it if he had been able to go back
some 3000 years in the past. Unfortunately, time travel and direct observation
of extinct cultures are beyond our capabilities, and that is why much
of the Poverty Point story must be written with such words as: seems, appears,
perhaps, maybe, and other equivocal terms. The Poverty Point story
is a patchwork of facts, hypotheses, guesses, and speculations. Often there
are many different ways to look at the same set of data. This is why there
are so many alternative interpretations and differences of opinion among
archaeologists who study this fascinating culture. This should not be mistaken
for a bad state of affairs. It is good and healthy. It is a sign to all that
much remains to be done before we can present a detailed picture in which
everyone can be confident.</p>
<p>But more than agreement or disagreement is the responsibility thrust
upon everyone&mdash;archaeologist and public alike&mdash;who thirst for understanding
of humankind. Poverty Point represents a charge and a commitment.
The proud people who were carriers of Poverty Point culture are all dead.
But the things they created, their magnificent achievements, their contributions
to the saga of human development on this planet live on. Theirs is
a legacy worth understanding.</p>
